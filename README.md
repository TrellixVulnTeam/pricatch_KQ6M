# Pricatch

Pricatch is a web application that keeps track of prices of products that you wish to buy. It will send you an email notification when the price of product you asked to track gets below a certain price that you entered.

This project is broken up into a backend and frontend. The backend contains the Django project which uses the Django Rest Framework to host a simple API. The frontend uses React and queries data from the API

It is a solo project and is a work under progress
